## How to use it

Since google want me to pay 5$ to register myself as an extension developer, I won't publish it because I don't know if someone else than me will use this extension. You still can use it for free by cloning the project and following this [instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).

I may someday publish it for real if I get 5$ from the community !
